## What Are Neural Networks? 🧠

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn patterns through training. These networks enable machines to perform tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making with remarkable accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning:** Multi-layered architectures for complex problem-solving.
- **Adaptability:** Ability to improve over time with more data.
- **Versatility:** Applicable across industries, from healthcare to entertainment.
